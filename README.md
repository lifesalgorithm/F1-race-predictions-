F1 Race Predictions
This project uses machine learning to predict the finishing positions of drivers in Formula 1 races. It includes race-specific notebooks for the Japanese Grand Prix and the Saudi Grand Prix.

Project Overview
Objective: Predict driver positions based on historical race data and relevant features.
Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
Models: Regression/classification models trained and evaluated for each race.
Data: Fast F1 api

Notebooks
Japanese_Grand_prix_predictions.ipynb â€” Builds and evaluates a model for the Japanese GP.
Saudi_Grand_Prix.ipynb â€” Builds and evaluates a model for the Saudi GP.

Key Steps
Data Collection & Cleaning
Load and preprocess historical race data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize features and target distributions.
Feature Engineering
Select and engineer relevant features for predictions.
Model Building
Train ML models to predict race outcomes.
Evaluation
Measure performance using appropriate metrics.
Predictions
Predict and interpret driver finishing positions.


âœ¨ Future Improvements
Automate data updates for upcoming races.
Experiment with advanced ML algorithms or ensemble models.
Integrate live race data for real-time predictions.
